# loops-
Integer userNum is read from input. Write a while loop that iterates while userNum is non-negative. In each iteration:

Update integer finalVal as follows:
If userNum is not divisible by 5, output "miss" and do not update finalVal.
Otherwise, output "hit" and increment finalVal.
Then, read the next integer from input into variable userNum.
End each output with a newline.
